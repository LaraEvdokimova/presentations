## Function concepts

- immutability
- currying
- partial application

- you don't need to be an academic
- Comparing to C#?
- tuples & records
- Take a look with ILSpy
- Use type system to model domain (discriminated unions)
- pattern matching
- active patterns
- F# as a scripting language


## Giraffe

- basic constructs
- routing
- modelbinding and why you take it for granted

## Fable

- Basic idea: transpile F# to AST that Babel can process
- Subset of System, FSharpCore
- No IL compilation

## FAKE

- F# make, DSL for build scripts
