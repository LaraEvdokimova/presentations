# Overview

The story I'd like to bring is one in a general sence of F# for web developers.
As it is quiet likely that the target audience will not know any F#, I'll start with an introduction.

Moving on to the main act being `Giraffe`. I'll explain the base constructs and demo some http handlers.
Ending the chapter with an actual production application. (nojaf-invoices).

Lastly I'd like to take a moment to illustrate that F# can also be used for frontend development.
The most popular example being Fable.
